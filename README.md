# K8-Portfolio
## Description
For this project, I created a web application where I can store and display the different projects I have completed as a web developer. I utilized flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables so that the style of the site enhances both the ease of navigation and the presentation of my work. Because more projects will be added to this site over time, the code for this web application was written with that in mind. Adaptable styling and responsive web design will ensure that my site is well presented no matter how many applications are add to the portfolio or what device is used to view the site.

## Given
I was given the following user story, acceptance criteria, and a mock up example of the desired end result to guide my building process.

### User Story
> AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
### Acceptance Criteria 

> #### WHEN I load their portfolio
> #### THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them`
> #### WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
> #### THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
> #### WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
> #### THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
> #### WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
> #### THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
> #### WHEN I click on the images of the applications
> #### THEN I am taken to that deployed application
> #### WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
> #### THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport`
